# Wine-Byond-help
A collection of tips and tricks for getting byond running on linux<br />

This guide is mostly based on the [Lutris](https://lutris.net/games/byond/) installer for now however more general and other installers are planned (feel free to pr) 

# Please do not use the default Proton-Ge wine provided with lutris
## (note: the current lutris script should do this for you)
if not please log an issue and attempt the manuel download as described<br />
webview2 requires patches made to wine in 10.5. Proton is based on 10.0, so until the wine patches are ported to GE or proton gets rebased to 11.0 please use a system wine instead
<br /> <br />

<br /> <br />
to do so in lutris before running the install script please press the wine button on the left side tab and then select system wine as default <br />
make sure the wine is newer then 10.5 if it is not please google your distro's guide for installing wine to update it (we suggest using staging-wine while you are at it)<br />

**alternatively if your package manager does not eaisly provide a sufficent wine version**<br />
you can press the small box icon and have lutris install some specfic wine versions. wine-10.8-staging-x86_64, wine-10.8-staging-tkg-ntsync-x86_64, and wine-10.7-staging-tk all work; however wine-10.8-staging-tkg-ntsync-x86_64 is recommended as its provides the best performance enhancing patches and supports NTSync which may (needs testing) improve byond performance in some facets.
TODO: test NTsync and add a guide for setting it up.

# Common issues
## I dont have audio on arch
install `pipewire-alsa` or some equivalent make sure your audio driver is set to alsa and that should make it work

## Lutris/Wine is not closing/opening after one launch
webview2 brings with it the Microsoft Edge Updater which (randomly) starts itself and has a very peculiar senese of when it wants to close which blocks lutris/wine from closing and therefore opening again<br />
<br />
You have two simple solutions which both boil down to killing the Edge Updater <br />

1. open the wine task manager (you can do this in lutris by pressing on the wine glass and pressing wine taskmanager) then go to processes and then end `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe*32` <br />
2. using your normal system task manager kill lutris/wine (depening on how you launch it) and then relaunch <br />


<br /><br />
after doing either of these you will be able to launch byond again without issue
<br /><br />
TODO: there is a script and some other ways to deal with this look into it and add them as the "hard way"

## mangohud does not work!
byond is 32 bit you need the 32 bit mango hud to have it work<br />
if you have it installed make sure dxvk is enabled some older installers disable it for byond

## Bad FPS on Nividia cards
enabling dxvk has helped alot with fixing fps issues on team green cards but others have reported it breaking Byond completely so try it and see which one are you!<br />
this has also been noted to sometimes cause flickering in tguis

## Nothing is rendering!!
not sure the cause of this but the easiest try disabling esync and fsync; exiting full-screen also seems to help sometimes. <br />
If those did not fix it or if you want a more stable solution [ntsync](https://docs.kernel.org/next/userspace-api/ntsync.html) has been found to a fix it as well. <br />
If your kernel is newer then 6.15 it is as simple as `# modprobe ntsync` and having a ntsync patched wine (the lutris script has this by default.) this will only enable it until you restart your computer but all distros have solutions for permanent module loading <br />
<br />
Here is some instructions for working with modules:<br />
[Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_module)<br />
[Fedora](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f40/system-administrators-guide/kernel-module-driver-configuration/Working_with_Kernel_Modules/)<br />

## If you dont see your issue here please open a issue on this repo 
I and others really dont mind helping people getting this setup
